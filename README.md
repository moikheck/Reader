#Michael Heckman's Book Reader
###This book creator/reader comes out of the box ready for twenty chapters, each up to eighteen pages!
You can customize different things about the book, including the front and back covers, the background color,
font size, type, and color, how many chapters there are, and more!

Front and back pictures: recommended size: 1200x1800 or equivalent ratio
Replace each of the files "front.png" and "back.png" with your own files. It works best if you rename your own files to "front" and "back". Otherwise, you have to change the code in `reader.html`.
